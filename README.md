# What is the motivation here?

I feel as though I spend most of my time learning web frameworks rather than learning about the web platform. 

This is going to be a place where I can experiment with building a web application using no framework or builder or bundler other than what I am able to spin up on my own. 

At this moment, I am going to be building this application using the Deno JavaScript runtime, but this is kind of an implementation detail.
